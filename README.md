## Clone, Verify, and Install Homelab ‚úÖ

### Script Authenticity ‚ö†Ô∏è

All scripts in this repository are digitally signed with my Keybase-managed PGP key.  
This ensures the scripts you download are authentic and haven‚Äôt been tampered with.

### Clone and Prepare
```
cd ~ # Go to your home directory (check with 'pwd')
git clone https://github.com/StianNOR/Homelab.git
cd Homelab
sudo chmod +x *.sh
```

### Import My Public Key

PGP fingerprint:  
`52FE58C1C8BDA54D68E09C143E305BD749B795A3`

```
curl https://keybase.io/sarttech7/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import

```


### Verify Scripts


```
gpg --verify signatures/setup_zsh.sh.asc setup_zsh.sh
gpg --verify signatures/up.sh.asc up.sh
gpg --verify signatures/portainerup.sh.asc portainerup.sh
gpg --verify signatures/portainer_docker_uninstall.sh.asc portainer_docker_uninstall.sh
gpg --verify signatures/uninstall_zsh_setup.sh.asc uninstall_zsh_setup.sh

> To mark it as trusted locally:  
> ```
> gpg --edit-key 3E305BD749B795A3
> trust
> # Select option 5 (ultimate trust)
